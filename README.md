## Usage
1. Dowload this 'ZIP' source code, extract the ZIP file to your local trusted path
2. Open your WebStorm
3. Open project: 'FILE -> OPEN -> *path to project* '
4. **Start to run** -> Open `load_remote.html` or `load_local.html` with FireFox/Chrome/Safari/Opera to see results 

## Test (skip)
1. Before test, it needs to download and use `jasmine 2.3.4` framework, jasmine is a T/BDD (test/behaviour-driven development), create your test specs before implementation code. I'm still studying on it currently, so I build my ugly impementation code first, just skip it right now, I'll rewrite the code follow its BDD later. 
2. Write your test under folder `spec`, with a `_spec` suffix, such as `jquery.renderAjax_spec.js`, open it with preferred browsers, if all-pass, the page will be green, otherwise, it will list the error items in red.
